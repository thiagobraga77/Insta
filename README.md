## 📝 About The Project

This project was developed as a personal challenge to practice and enhance front-end skills. The main goal was to replicate the Instagram login page with high visual fidelity, focusing on a clean HTML structure and a responsive layout built entirely with CSS, without relying on any frameworks.

It serves as a demonstration of proficiency in:
* Semantic HTML5 markup.
* Advanced CSS styling and layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid).
* Creating responsive designs that adapt to both mobile and desktop screens.
